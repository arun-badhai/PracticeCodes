# PracticeCodes

In the field of Computer Science, there are infinite problems and these problems have finite solutions but, out of these solutions, there are only a few which are optimal and most favorable. This repository includes few coding problems and their optimised solutions. These solutions involve use of efficient data structures, optimised algorithms and techniques reducing the overall complexity (space and time) of the program.

Program 1: Atoi

In this program, I have converted the string into an integer.

I have considered the following corner cases:
a. Whitespace in the string are removed
b. Empty string
c. Positive or negative sign appended at the start of the string
d. Constraint on maximum and minimum value

Using mathematical logic, calculated the integer value of the string.
