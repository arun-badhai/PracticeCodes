# PracticeCodes

In the field of Computer Science, there are infinite problems and these problems have finite solutions but, out of these solutions, there are only a few which are optimal and most favorable. This repository includes few coding problems and their optimised solutions. These solutions involve use of efficient data structures, optimised algorithms and techniques reducing the overall complexity (space and time) of the program.

Folder 1: Sorting app

Program 1: Atoi

In this program, I have converted the string into an integer.

I have considered the following corner cases:

a. Whitespace in the string are removed

b. Empty string

c. Positive or negative sign appended at the start of the string

d. Constraint on maximum and minimum value

Using mathematical logic, calculated the integer value of the string.

Program 2: Count and Say

Program 3 : Evaluate a given expression

In this program, I have used a stack, in which I will keep inserting all the numbers from a given string until it reaches an operator and once the operator is found, I will take out the last two elements and perform the required operation using the two numbers and the operator. This will continue, till the final value is pushed into the stack and then, popped from the stack.

Program 4: Grid Paths

In this program, I have used recursion, inorder to find the total number of unique paths between the first grid and the last grid.

Program 5: Maximum block of ones

In a given matrix of one's and zero's, find the maximum size of a block (square block) containing one's.

Program 6: Rain water stack

Program 7: Common Prefix
